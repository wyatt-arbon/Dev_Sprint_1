          <h3>What is referencing?</h3>
          <p>Learning at university may be different to learning at school or
            college. Lecturers will not usually supply you with all the reading
            you need to complete your assignments. They expect you to research
            and read independently. You may read books, online journal articles
            or research on the web. This is called wide reading. When you write
            academic assignments, you must demonstrate your wide reading by
            citing ideas or concepts from this wide reading. Citations are
            academics’ way of showing that they are using someone else’s ideas,
            concepts, theories or actual words. Plagiarism is the presentation
            of the ideas and words of another writer, artist, film maker
            etcetera as you own without any form of acknowledgement. Plagiarism
            can easily be avoided if you document the relevant sources which you
            have used.</p>

          <h3>Why do we reference?</h3>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>You are indicating that you have read published writing in the
                area you are studying.</li>
              <li>Referencing allows you support your arguments.</li>
              <li>You demonstrate that you are aware of and understand other
                opinions in the area you are studying by referring to authors
                who have written about them.</li>
              <li>Using references allows you to demonstrate your ability to
                assess, compare and contrast, critically analyse and evaluate
                competing arguments.</li>
              <li>Referring to documented evidence lends weight to and validates
                your argument.</li>
              <li>Accurate references allow others to consult the same sources
                you have used.</li>
              <li>To avoid plagiarism, you need to reference, in text and in the
                reference list, accurately.</li>
            </ul>
